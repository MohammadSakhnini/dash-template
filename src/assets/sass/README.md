In case you are going to use the Sass rather than the CSS, you should store the comiled CSS files in the `src/assets/stylesheets` directory. The `src/assets/sass` directory is used for the Sass files only.*This is already defined under .vscode/settings.json file* in case you are using a Visual Studio Code Sass extension.
